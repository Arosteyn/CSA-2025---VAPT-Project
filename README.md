# Cyber Attack Lifecycle & VAPT Project
This repository is for showcasing my cybersecurity project reports. All content is view-only.
## 📌 Project Background
This repository contains my course project from ICTAK covering the **Cyber Attack Lifecycle** and hands-on **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**.  
The project was executed in multiple phases: Literature Survey, Reconnaissance, Vulnerability Assessment, and Penetration Testing.  

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Study the Cyber Attack Lifecycle across different environments  
- Perform VAPT on a given target system  
- Document findings and methodologies for each phase  
- Compare approaches across environments (e.g., IoT, Web Applications)  

## 📅 Timeline & Deadlines
| Phase | Start Date | Submission Date | Review Date | Submission Type |

| Phase 1: Literature Survey | 23 Jul 2025 | 29 Jul 2025 | 30 Jul 2025 | Individual |
| Phase 2: Reconnaissance | 01 Aug 2025 | 08 Aug 2025 | 09 Aug 2025 | Group |
| Phase 3: Vulnerability Assessment | 10 Aug 2025 | 17 Aug 2025 | 21 Aug 2025 | Group |
| Phase 4: Penetration Testing | 24 Aug 2025 | Final Exercise | Live Test | Group |
| Phase 5: Bug Bounty Report | 31 Aug 2025 | Additional Activity | Self Exploartion | Individual |

## 🛠️ Phases Overview  
- **Phase 1 – Literature Survey**: Reviewed cyber attack lifecycle and compared it with VAPT methodology.  
- **Phase 2 – Reconnaissance**: Collected target environment details, documented work allocation & public IPs.  
- **Phase 3 – Vulnerability Assessment**: Identified vulnerabilities using Phase 1 methods & Phase 2 intel.  
- **Phase 4 – Penetration Testing**: Confirmed findings, exploited safely, documented PoCs with screenshots, impact & mitigation.
- **Phase 5 – Bug Bounty Program**: Practiced with Vulnerability Disclosure Programs & intentionally vulnerable labs. 

## 📝 Reports & Templates
Each phase folder contains:
- Phase-wise report  
- Work allocation table   
- Screenshots & findings  
- Mitigation recommendations
